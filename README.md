# DT207-moment2-backend

A modular API and business logic backend. 

It uses a SQLite database for data persistence and the `zod` library to type-check incoming API data. Data access is done via `better-sqlite3` which is a library that contains synchronous methods.

**Note:** The `workExperienceRepository` interface uses async method signatures even though `better-sqlite3` itself is sync.
Thatâ€™s intentional, because it keeps things flexible if you ever swap out the database for something async like PostgreSQL or MongoDB. This way, you donâ€™t need two separate interfaces just to support different drivers.

For this project, only SQLite is used, but it's written with future-proofing in mind as if you're building something production-ready, not just a one-off assignment.

Also, the next assignment requires MongoDB for data persistence, which this project can easily support by just adding a custom repository layer. Nothing else needs to change. 
Well, aside from the fact that I no longer need to deal with date string conversions, thanks to MongoDBâ€™s support for native Date objects.

## ðŸ“Š Data structure

The database consists of a single `WorkExperiences` table, structured as follows:

| Column       | Type         | Description              |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| `Id`         | `INT`        | Primary key (auto-increment) |
| `CompanyName`| `TEXT`       | Name of the company      |
| `JobTitle`   | `TEXT`       | Name of the Job title    |
| `StartDate`  | `TEXT`       | Job start date           |
| `EndDate`    | `TEXT`       | Job end date             |
| `Description`| `TEXT`       | Job description          |
